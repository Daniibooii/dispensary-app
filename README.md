# Project Description
This project is a group effort to aid those suffering from illnesses whose symptoms can be treated by use of medicinal marijuana.<br>
We aim to give them the ability to find out which specific products are best-suited to their medical needs.<br>

The project was conceived and organized by Daniel Mace;<br>
it was developed by a four-person team over one week.<br>
The total time spent developing our project, including time spent learning new tools, is estimated at 100+ hours.<br>

We utilized HTML, CSS with Material Design Lite, Javascript with JQuery, Node.js with dependencies including handlebars.js, passport.js and sequelize.js, MySQL with WorkBench, and an external API as well as our local API/database.<br>

Internally, we had to carefully-structure our folders and files, set up a database, line up all our routes, set up HTML files with handlebars, and code listeners/etc. for buttons on our HTML pages.<br>
We were not able to find the ideal API for this project's specific needs, but still made use of Otreeba for research purposes.<br>
Further use of APIs is possible in the future.<br>
