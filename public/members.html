                <p>Pineapple Express combines the potent and flavorful forces of parent strains Trainwreck and Hawaiian. The smell is likened to fresh apple and mango, with a taste of pineapple, pine, and cedar. This hard-hitting sativa-dominant hybrid provides a long-lasting energetic buzz perfect for productive afternoons and creative escapes.</p>

                <p>Harlequin, with its 1:1 ratio of THC and CBD, is the perfect solution for anyone needing a clear head alongside their depression relief. CBD helps counteract the sometimes anxiety-inducing effects of THC, so if you’re prone to nerves, Harlequin is for you.</p>
                <p>Harlequin is a 75/25 sativa-dominant strain renowned for its reliable expression of CBD. A descendant of Colombian Gold, a Nepali indica, and Thai and Swiss landrace strains, you can depend on Harlequin to provide clear-headed, alert sativa effects. Unlike most high-CBD strains, Harlequin almost always develops a CBD:THC ratio of 5:2, making this strain one of the most effective out there for treatment of pain and anxiety, as CBD can counteract THC’s paranoia while amplifying its painkilling properties. Flavors can range from earthy musk to sweet mango, but without a doubt, what draws crowds to Harlequin is its ability to relax without sedation and to relieve without intoxication.</p>

                <p>XJ-13 is a sativa-dominant strain cherished for both its therapeutic potency and enjoyable euphoric buzz. This hybrid cross of Jack Herer and G13 Haze induces unencumbered cerebral effects perfect for stimulating creativity and conversation.

This strain, sometimes referred to as Lavender Kush, has dense buds that give off a floral and spicy aroma. It has a dark purple coloration at the ends of its leaves.</p>

                <p>Granddaddy Purple is an indica strain that awakens appetite without worsening anxiety, but this strain is best saved for the evening if chronic fatigue is a problem for you.</p>
                <p>Introduced in 2003 by Ken Estes, Granddaddy Purple (or GDP) is a famous indica cross between Purple Urkle and Big Bud. This California staple inherits a complex grape and berry aroma from its Purple Urkle parent, while Big Bud passes on its oversized, compact bud structure. GDP flowers bloom in shades of deep purple, a contrastive backdrop for its snow-like dusting of white crystal resin.</p>
                <p>Its potent psychoactive effects are clearly detectable in both mind and body, delivering a fusion of cerebral euphoria and physical relaxation. While your thoughts may float in a dreamy buzz, your body is more likely to find itself fixed in one spot for the duration of GDP’s effects. Like most heavy indica varieties, Granddaddy Purple is typically pulled off the shelf to treat pain, stress, insomnia, appetite loss, and muscle spasms. GDP blesses growers with massive commercial yields which are ready for harvest following a 60 day flowering time indoors.</p>

                <p>Blackberry Kush is a perfect late-night indica that brings a heavy, peaceful calm to both mind and body.</p>
                <p>This mostly indica strain is a mix of Afghani and Blackberry strains and has beautiful dark purple buds with orange hairs. Plants will flower at 7-8 weeks and are not particularly high yielders, but the dense, hard nugs have crystals throughout. Blackberry Kush tends to have a hashy, jet fuel smell and taste that is balanced by sweet berries. Blackberry Kush is often recommended for the treatment of pain thanks to its strong indica body effects.</p>

                <p>All hail ACDC, one of the most effective painkilling strains out there due to its one-two punch of cannabinoids CBD and THC. As a general rule, cannabis strains with high amounts of both THC and CBD tend to make the best pain medicines, and there are plenty of high-CBD strains out there offering similar chemical profiles as ACDC.</p>
                <p>ACDC is a sativa-dominant phenotype of the high-CBD cannabis strain, Cannatonic. One remarkable characteristic of ACDC is its THC:CBD ratio of 1:20, meaning this strain induces little to no intoxicating effects. Tests have put ACDC’s CBD content as high as 19%, which helps many patients treat pain, anxiety, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, and the negative effects of chemotherapy, all with a clear head.</p>

                <img src ="images/bw.png">
                <p>Also known as Blue Venom, Berry White, and White Berry, Blue Widow is a prolific hybrid cross between parent strains Blueberry and White Widow. Leafly user reviews praise Blue Widow for its anti-inflammatory qualities, and perhaps the reason for this is Blue Widow’s rich terpene profile that typically boasts high levels of caryophyllene, or it could be its heavy resin production which gives way to massive amounts of THC and other beneficial compounds.</p>
                <p>Blue Widow is a favorite strain that provides consumers with both uplifting and calming effects. These flowers will have a strong sweet aroma that may also include sour citrus or pine. The buds can be colorful, with tints of blue and purple, and should have a coat of long orange hairs. Slightly indica-dominant, this Widow plays against type, growing taller than most indicas and providing more mental, heady effects. In higher doses, the blissful relaxation this strain provides may lead to drowsiness and help you get to sleep. A cross between Blueberry and White Widow, Blue Widow is sometimes also called Berry White, White Berry, and Blue Venom.</p>

                <p>When it comes to knocking out pain, no medical strain hits the target quite like Purple Arrow. This hybrid provides effective relief for severe pain while simultaneously inducing a sense of uplift and euphoria. Extremely well-rounded, Purple Arrow is potent without causing that over-medicated feeling of some pain relief strains. The uniqueness of this strain is complemented by its earthy aroma. Fragrant, herbal, and a little sweet, this strain tastes almost as good as it feels. When you need immediate relief and would like to stay off the couch, Purple Arrow is a fantastic choice.</p>

                <p>Dynamite is another high-THC indica strain that blows pain and cramping out of the water, but be wary: Dynamite is also known to incite the power of the Munchie Beast.</p>
                <p>Dynamite is a short and bushy indica strain that offers an aroma of sweet grapefruit and mixed fruit. Heavy physical effects weigh down the limbs and relax muscles, but Dynamite provides the mind with an invigorating spark to fuel creativity and conversation. The subtle, sweet aroma of grapefruit and mixed fruit breaks free from the bud when ground up. A quick finisher, Dynamite completes its flowering cycle in 7 to 8 weeks, yielding a heavy harvest of buds that may bloom in stunning hues of purple and pink.</p>

                <p>This is the combination of LA Confidential and OG Kush. This strain was created by DNA Genetics and it has blankets of crystals and looks almost grayish-black.</p>
                <p>The effect is good for pain, eating and sleep disorders. Most describe Cataract as a "creeper" high that keeps on building long after you stop smoking! This strain has been years in the making and is NOT recommended for the light-weight smoker. After you experience the Cataract Kush you'll think you have cataracts!</p>

            <p class="truncate">He's calm, determined, humble and perhaps a little too conceited. But there's more than meets the eye, not surprising for somebody with his position. He was born in an ordinary family in an average town. He lived comfortably until he was about 19 years old, but at that point life changed. He moved to another country and was strengthening the relationship with both parents. Having overcome plenty of obstacles, he struggles to make it in a fast changing world. But with his curiosity and persistence, there's nothing to stop him from staying ahead of the game. He could quickly become a friend you'd want by your side. But things could change quickly; he is currently still learning, exploring and discovering. He feels like there's more to enjoy in this world. Luckily he has wise teachers and great friends to support him.</p>

He was born in a loving family in a developed community. He lived in peace until he was about 18 years old, but at that point life began to change. He started to travel the world and was very successful. With plenty of money and connections, he is discovering hidden treasures in a strange world. But with his diligence and wits, there's nothing to stop him from finding a way to the top. He could quickly become an ally you'd want by your side. However, he is currently still finding the right place in the world. He feels like there's more than people let on in this world. Luckily he has great people around to support him.</p>

            <p class="truncate">Silver, frizzy hair almost fully covers a thin, menacing face. Small green eyes, set far within their sockets, watch hungrily over the lands they've sought solace in for so long. A scar stretching from the bottom of the right cheekbone , running towards the other eye and ending above her left eye leaves an agonizing memory of redeemed honor. The is the face of Nexlee Greaseblast, a true guardian among goblins. She stands big among others, despite her heavy frame. There's something wonderful about her, perhaps it's her clumsiness or perhaps it's simply her good looks. But nonetheless, people tend to thank her for her service, while treating her to a good meal when she's around.</p>

            <p class="truncate">She's crafty, impatient and versatile. Which isn't out of the ordinary for someone with her ugly past. She was born and grew up in a lower class family in a normal town, she lived happily until she was about 10 years old, but at that point everything changed. She lost her sisters in a long lasting heatwave and was now alone and forgotten. With the help of a suspicious stranger she had to survive in a pitiless world. But with her persistance and courage, she managed to find a new home and survive everything. This has turned her into the woman she is today. Having finally found some peace of mind, she now works tracking the people of the past. By doing so, she hopes to learn more about the past and finally find tranquility she has never had.</p>
